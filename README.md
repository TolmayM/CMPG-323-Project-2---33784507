<h2>Project discription</h2>
In this project I will be creating a CRUD RESTful API that will connect to a database containing information about IoT devices. My API will have one get, post, patch, and delete method for each resource specified. The RESTful API architecture includes a number of endpoints used for HTTP requests that run application code to update databases.
